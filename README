CAW!!!

CAW is a easily customizable taskbar written in Python.

Dependencies
--

libxcb 1.2
xcb-proto 1.4
xcb-util 0.3.4
xpyb 1.1
cairo 1.8.8


Building
--
python setup.py build


Running
--
./caw


Configuration
--
Currently configuration is done by modifying the 'caw' python file or creating
your own, importing the caw modules and running that file.  This allows you to
add external modules etc.


TODO
--
Taskbar support is experimental.  It works but the truncation of long lines is
done on the Python side and can be fairly intense.  Mainly, the truncation
values need to be remembered or something should be done.  I don't personally
use this feature but the truncation stuff could be put in the C module.

Move text support to pango.

Every widget gets updated on every redraw.  There are times when this is
unnecessary.  We should only need to update the widgets that have changed as
long as their width hasn't changed.

There is a lot left to do.  Contributions are highly welcomed.


Notes
--
I tried as much as possible to use the XPYB implementation but there are some
things (such as cairo drawing) that cannot be done on the Python side using XCB.
The choice to use XCB was two-fold: to learn xcb and to use something that is
predicted to be the new xlib (maybe?).  Anyways, I am using openbox, it relies
on pango which in-turn relies on cairo so that is OK.
