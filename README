Notes
--
I tried as much as possible to use the XPYB implementation but there are some
things (such as cairo drawing) that cannot be done on the Python side using XCB.
The choice to use XCB was two-fold: to learn xcb and to use something that is
predicted to be the new xlib (maybe?).  Anyways, I am using openbox, it relies
on pango which in-turn relies on cairo so that is OK.
